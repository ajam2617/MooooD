## About

What is MoooooD?
	At MoooooD, we believe a journal should be more than just a journal with memories. After writing a journal entry and taking a quick snapshot, MoooooD uses Indicoâ€™s API and Face++ to give an unique and accurate machine based understanding of your everyday emotions.(insert AI buzzword somewhere around here). After using MooooD, we hope you can visualize how your mood changes from day to day! 

##Basic Usage
Scroll down to enter a journal entry and submit an image, either [URL] or [UpLoad], and watch the magic happen! Sentiment based analytics returns feedback on both the journal entry text and the image. Log in to track your progress. 

##How it Works
We used Google Firebase to store information on User Profiles and API response feedback from Indico and Face++. 
Imgur was used to send image to Face++ API. 
Bootstrap templates and Google Fonts.
AnyChart for result feedback.
jQuery
